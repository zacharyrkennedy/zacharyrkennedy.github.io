            For the better part of the year, my task at HARBOR was getting the software of the mini-MSA version 2 working.
            I started just by reading UART data from the sensors and then needed to find a way to communicate effectively with the MSA.
            So, I altered the Raspberry Pi to host a WiFi access point that could be connected to remotely to control the MSA...

              During my Spring 2021 semester at Weber State, I took PHYS 2300 - Scientific Computing, a course that I can only describe as programming basic physics simulations in Python.
              For our final project in that class, we were tasked with creating a physics simulation of our own creation. Naturally, being the nerd I am, I decided to program the physics 
              of a rocket launch simulation when launching from different planetary bodies...

            While working on my exoplanet research, I found that the simulation software I was using required specific units and values to be used for variables. To do it all by hand would
            have been especially tedious, so I created some software that will take all of the information entered and output new numbers doing that calculations and in the correct units...

          <p>
              Funded by the Jim S. Bateman undergraduate research award grant, I have been doing simulations and research on potentially habitable exoplanets from NASA's exoplanet database. Through 
              this process, I have written a number of scripts to help me, including my featured planetary value converter software. I'm currently in the process of still conducting my research, 
              but I hope to have a paper of my research published by the end of the summer...

               From January 2020 to May 2020, I participated in a remote internship hosted by NASA and Arizona State University. We were broken into teams of 12 and told to come up with a Mission 
               Concept Proposal for a hypothetical lunar landing mission, looking for water on the Moon. We had to come up with every detail from the design of our rover/probe and what instruments
               it would carry...

                For my job as a telescope operator, I'm often dealing with large amounts of data, usually in the form of an overbearing excel spreadsheet. Hating the amount of time It takes to
                do stuff in Microsoft Excel, I decided to write a python script that will take the data excel file outputted by the AstroImageJ photometry and run it through and produce a nice looking
                graph according to your specifications...
